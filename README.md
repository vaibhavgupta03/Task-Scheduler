# Task-Scheduler
Develop a task scheduler in C++ that manages and executes tasks based on their priority. The scheduler should handle task scheduling efficiently using a priority queue.

# Understanding the Priority Queue
A priority queue is a data structure where each element has a priority associated with it. In the context of a task scheduler:

- Higher priority tasks should be executed before lower priority tasks.
- If two tasks have the same priority, they can be executed in the order they were added (FIFO).
